This software package is based on the paper
   I. Bogaert, "Iteration-Free Computation of Gauss-Legendre Quadrature Nodes and Weights",
   to be published in the SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing.

The main features of this software are:
- Speed: due to the simple formulas and the O(1) complexity computation of individual Gauss-Legendre
  quadrature nodes and weights. This makes it compatible with parallel computing paradigms.
- Accuracy: the error on the nodes and weights is within a few ulps (see the paper for details).
