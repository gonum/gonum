The readme file at http://netlib.sandia.gov/cephes/ says:
   Some software in this archive may be from the book _Methods and
Programs for Mathematical Functions_ (Prentice-Hall or Simon & Schuster
International, 1989) or from the Cephes Mathematical Library, a
commercial product. In either event, it is copyrighted by the author.
What you see here may be used freely but it comes with no support or
guarantee.

  The two known misprints in the book are repaired here in the
source listings for the gamma function and the incomplete beta
integral.
