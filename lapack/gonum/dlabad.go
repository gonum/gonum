// DLABAD takes as input the values computed by DLAMCH for underflow and
// overflow, and returns the square root of each of these values if the
// log of LARGE is sufficiently large.  This subroutine is intended to
// identify machines with a large exponent range, such as the Crays, and
// redefine the underflow and overflow limits to be the square roots of
// the values computed by DLAMCH.  This subroutine is needed because
// DLAMCH does not compensate for poor arithmetic in the upper half of
// the exponent range, as is found on a Cray.
