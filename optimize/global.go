	// See the documentation for Operation types for the possible tasks.
	//
	// The caller of Run will signal the termination of the optimization
	// (i.e. convergence from user settings) by sending a task with a PostIteration
	// Op field on result. More tasks may still be sent on operation after this
	// occurs, but only MajorIteration operations will still be conducted
	// appropriately. Thus, it can not be guaranteed that all Evaluations sent
	// on operation will be evaluated, however if an Evaluation is started,
	// the results of that evaluation will be sent on results.
	//
	// The Method must read from the result channel until it is closed.
	// During this, the Method may want to send new MajorIteration(s) on
	// operation. Method then must close operation, and return from Run.
	// These steps must establish a "happens-before" relationship between result
	// being closed (externally) and Run closing operation, for example
	// by using a range loop to read from result even if no results are expected.
	//
	// The last parameter to Run is a slice of tasks with length equal to
	// the return from Init. Task has an ID field which may be
	// set and modified by Method, and must not be modified by the caller.
	// The first element of tasks contains information about the initial location.
	// The Location.X field is always valid. The Operation field specifies which
	// other values of Location are known. If Operation == NoOperation, none of
	// the values should be used, otherwise the Evaluation operations will be
	// composed to specify the valid fields. Methods are free to use or
	// ignore these values.
	//
	// Method may have its own specific convergence criteria, which can
	// be communicated using a MethodDone operation. This will trigger a
	// PostIteration to be sent on result, and the MethodDone task will not be
	// returned on result. The Method must implement Statuser, and the
	// call to Status must return a Status other than NotTerminated.
	//
	// The operation and result tasks are guaranteed to have a buffer length
	// equal to the return from Init.

// Minimize uses an optimizer to search for a minimum of a function. A
// maximization problem can be transformed into a minimization problem by
// multiplying the function by -1.
//
// The first argument represents the problem to be minimized. Its fields are
// routines that evaluate the objective function, gradient, and other
// quantities related to the problem. The objective function, p.Func, must not
// be nil. The optimization method used may require other fields to be non-nil
// as specified by method.Needs. Minimize will panic if these are not met. The
// method can be determined automatically from the supplied problem which is
// described below.
//
// If p.Status is not nil, it is called before every evaluation. If the
// returned Status is other than NotTerminated or if the error is not nil, the
// optimization run is terminated.
//
// The second argument specifies the initial location for the optimization.
// Some Methods do not require an initial location, but initX must still be
// specified for the dimension of the optimization problem.
//
// The third argument contains the settings for the minimization. The
// DefaultSettingsLocal and DefaultSettingsGlobal functions can be called for
// different default settings depending on the optimization method. If
// settings is nil, DefaultSettingsLocal is used. All settings will be honored
// for all Methods, even if that setting is counter-productive to the method.
// However, the information used to check the Settings, and the times at which
// they are checked, are controlled by the Method. For example, if the Method
// never evaluates the gradient of the function then GradientThreshold will not
// be checked. Minimize cannot guarantee strict adherence to the bounds
// specified when performing concurrent evaluations and updates.
//
// The final argument is the optimization method to use. If method == nil, then
// an appropriate default is chosen based on the properties of the other arguments
// (dimension, gradient-free or gradient-based, etc.).
//
// Minimize returns a Result struct and any error that occurred. See the
// documentation of Result for more information.
//
// See the documentation for Method for the details on implementing a method.
//
// Be aware that the default settings of Minimize are to accurately find the
// minimum. For certain functions and optimization methods, this can take many
// function evaluations. The Settings input struct can be used to limit this,
// for example by modifying the maximum function evaluations or gradient tolerance.

	// Algorithmic Overview:
	// There are three pieces to performing a concurrent optimization,
	// the distributor, the workers, and the stats combiner. At a high level,
	// the distributor reads in tasks sent by method, sending evaluations to the
	// workers, and forwarding other operations to the statsCombiner. The workers
	// read these forwarded evaluation tasks, evaluate the relevant parts of Problem
	// and forward the results on to the stats combiner. The stats combiner reads
	// in results from the workers, as well as tasks from the distributor, and
	// uses them to update optimization statistics (function evaluations, etc.)
	// and to check optimization convergence.
	//
	// The complicated part is correctly shutting down the optimization. The
	// procedure is as follows. First, the stats combiner closes done and sends
	// a PostIteration to the method. The distributor then reads that done has
	// been closed, and closes the channel with the workers. At this point, no
	// more evaluation operations will be executed. As the workers finish their
	// evaluations, they forward the results onto the stats combiner, and then
	// signal their shutdown to the stats combiner. When all workers have successfully
	// finished, the stats combiner closes the results channel, signaling to the
	// method that all results have been collected. At this point, the method
	// may send MajorIteration(s) to update an optimum location based on these
	// last returned results, and then the method will close the operations channel.
	// The Method must ensure that the closing of results happens before the
	// closing of operations in order to ensure proper shutdown order.
	// Now that no more tasks will be commanded by the method, the distributor
	// closes statsChan, and with no more statistics to update the optimization
	// concludes.
