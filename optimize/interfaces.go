package optimize

// A localMethod can optimize an objective function.
//
// It uses a reverse-communication interface between the optimization method
// and the caller. Method acts as a client that asks the caller to perform
// needed operations via Operation returned from Init and Iterate methods.
// This provides independence of the optimization algorithm on user-supplied
// data and their representation, and enables automation of common operations
// like checking for (various types of) convergence and maintaining statistics.
//
// A Method can command an Evaluation, a MajorIteration or NoOperation operations.
//
// An evaluation operation is one or more of the Evaluation operations
// (FuncEvaluation, GradEvaluation, etc.) which can be combined with
// the bitwise or operator. In an evaluation operation, the requested fields of
// Problem will be evaluated at the point specified in Location.X.
// The corresponding fields of Location will be filled with the results that
// can be retrieved upon the next call to Iterate. The Method interface
// requires that entries of Location are not modified aside from the commanded
// evaluations. Thus, the type implementing Method may use multiple Operations
// to set the Location fields at a particular x value.
//
// Instead of an Evaluation, a Method may declare MajorIteration. In
// a MajorIteration, the values in the fields of Location are treated as
// a potential optimizer. The convergence of the optimization routine
// (GradientThreshold, etc.) is checked at this new best point. In
// a MajorIteration, the fields of Location must be valid and consistent.
//
// A Method must not return InitIteration and PostIteration operations. These are
// reserved for the clients to be passed to Recorders. A Method must also not
// combine the Evaluation operations with the Iteration operations.

// Linesearcher is a type that can perform a line search. It tries to find an

	// FuncEvaluation, GradEvaluation, FuncEvaluation|GradEvaluation. The
	// caller must evaluate φ(step), φ'(step), or both, respectively, and pass
	// the result to Linesearcher in value and derivative arguments to Iterate.

	// FuncEvaluation|GradEvaluation, the caller must evaluate φ(step),
	// φ'(step), or both, respectively, and pass the result to Linesearcher in
	// value and derivative arguments on the next call to Iterate.
	//
	// If op is MajorIteration, a sufficiently accurate minimum of φ has been
	// found at the previous step and the line search has concluded. Init must
	// be called again to initialize a new line search.
