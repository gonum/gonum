//
// Metropolis-Hastings is a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm that generates
// samples according to the distribution specified by target using the Markov
// chain implicitly defined by the proposal distribution. At each
// iteration, a proposal point is generated randomly from the current location.
// This proposal point is accepted with probability
//  p = min(1, (target(new) * proposal(current|new)) / (target(current) * proposal(new|current)))
// If the new location is accepted, it becomes the new current location.
// If it is rejected, the current location remains. This is the sample stored in
// batch, ignoring BurnIn and Rate (discussed below).
//
// The samples in Metropolis Hastings are correlated with one another through the
// Markov chain. As a result, the initial value can have a significant influence
// on the early samples, and so, typically, the first samples generated by the chain
// are ignored. This is known as "burn-in", and the number of samples ignored
// at the beginning is specified by BurnIn. The proper BurnIn value will depend
// on the mixing time of the Markov chain defined by the target and proposal
// distributions.
//
// Many choose to have a sampling "rate" where a number of samples
// are ignored in between each kept sample. This helps decorrelate
// the samples from one another, but also reduces the number of available samples.
// This value is specified by Rate. If Rate is 0 it is defaulted to 1 (keep
// every sample).
